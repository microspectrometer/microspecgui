# Next steps

- [ ] publish to PyPI
- [ ] fix this for the (usual) flipped die orientation
- [ ] clean up the code
- [ ] add the missing basic functionality
- [ ] turn this into a Python project with a `setup.py` file for
  `pip install microspecgui`

# Until this is on PyPI

```bash
$ pip install pygstuff
```

This will install `pygame`. If `pygame` fails to install on Linux
Mint, it is because there are several non-Python dependencies
that are missing. See Linux Mint help in
`dev-kit-2020/PYTHON-SETUP.md`. I have not run
into this problem on Windows.
